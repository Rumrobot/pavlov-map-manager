# Pavlov Map Manager
This is a program, which lets you manage your pavlov maps outside of pavlov. It only works for Windows at the moment.

You can download the compiled program under [releases]([url](https://github.com/Rumrobot/pavlov-map-manager/releases))

### This is still under development! Dont expect everything to work.
